# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Final-Project

This repository includes the following files:

* run_analysis.R
* CodeBook.md
* FinalTidyDataSet.txt

The R script is the programming which was used to consume the .txt files for this project and transform them into tidy data sets for analytical consumption.

The CodeBook file details the context of this project, the source data, the transformations made by the R script, and the resulting new variables.

Finally, the .txt data set is the resulting tidy data set after executing the R script.
